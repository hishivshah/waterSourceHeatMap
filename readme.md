# High Level Water Source Heat Map

Water source heat pumps have the potential to provide low carbon and renewable energy to buildings located near rivers. An assessment of the suitability of major Welsh rivers for water source heat pump deployment has been carried out, and the results summarised on a national scale map.

Python scripts were used to process and analyse the data. These can be found within the code directory.
