Water source heat pumps have the potential to provide low carbon and renewable heating to buildings located near rivers. A high level assessment of the suitability of major Welsh rivers for water source heat pump deployment is being carried out. Based on gauged monthly flow data obtained from the National River Flow Archive, the maximum annual heat production for rivers where gauging station data is available has been calculated, and the results summarised on a national scale map. Current work is focused on interpolating river flow data to expand coverage of the analysis to river reaches without a gauging station site. In addition, a complementary analysis is being developed for the heat energy demand from buildings located close to rivers. This will allow potential opportunities for deploying water source heat pump technology to be identified through matching heat energy supply and demand.
