Water source heat pumps have the potential to provide low carbon and renewable heating to buildings located near rivers. A high level assessment of the suitability of major Welsh rivers for water source heat pump deployment has been carried out, and the results summarised on a national scale map. Gauged monthly flow data was obtained from the National River Flow Archive, and matched to a network of large and medium sized rivers derived from the Ordnance Survey's Meridian 2 dataset, to calculate the mean flow rates for each river where data was available. The maximum annual heat production of each river was derived from its flow rate, taking into account constraints on the change in river temperature, heat pump capacity and available land. A map has been produced to highlight potential opportunities for deploying water source heat pump technology, displaying the maximum annual heat production for each of the rivers analysed in 500 GWh/year class intervals, along with the locations of major settlements and urban areas where heat demand is likely to be highest.
